### [36\. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3.  Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

<small style="display: inline;">A partially filled sudoku which is valid.</small>

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8\. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Note:**

*   A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
*   Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
*   The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
*   The given board size is always `9x9`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    
    bool cel[4][4][10]={0}, x[10][10]={0}, y[10][10]={0};
    
    bool check(int i, int j, int tmp) {
        return cel[i/3][j/3][tmp] || x[i][tmp] || y[j][tmp] ;
    }
    
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        for(int i=0; i<9; ++i)
            for(int j=0; j<9; ++j)
                if(board[i][j] != '.') {
                    int tmp = board[i][j]-'0';
                    if(!check(i, j , tmp))
                        cel[i/3][j/3][tmp] = x[i][tmp] = y[j][tmp]= 1;
                    else return false;
                }
        return true;
    }
};
